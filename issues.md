## Token Transfer Issues Log

### Initial Issues
1. Network Connection:
   - Successfully connects to network with chainId: 2370
   - Network name reported as "unknown"
   - Basic RPC methods working (eth_chainId, eth_accounts, eth_blockNumber)

2. Transaction Processing Errors:
   - Initial attempts failed with various `InvalidCharacter` errors
   - Tried multiple transaction encoding formats without success

### Solution Found
1. RPC Method Support:
   - Standard Ethereum RPC methods are supported
   - Confirmed working methods:
     - eth_chainId: Returns "0x942"
     - eth_accounts: Returns account list
     - eth_blockNumber: Returns current block
     - eth_gasPrice: Returns "0xb2d05e00"
     - eth_getTransactionCount: Returns nonce
     - eth_sendRawTransaction: Accepts signed transactions

2. Transaction Format:
   - Must use standard Ethereum transaction format
   - Required fields:
     - from: sender address
     - to: recipient address
     - value: amount in wei (hex)
     - nonce: transaction sequence number (hex)
     - gasPrice: from eth_gasPrice
     - gasLimit: standard 21000 (0x5208)
     - chainId: network chain ID (2370)

3. Transaction Flow:
   1. Get current gas price using eth_gasPrice
   2. Get sender's nonce using eth_getTransactionCount
   3. Prepare transaction with all required fields
   4. Sign transaction using sender's private key
   5. Send raw transaction using eth_sendRawTransaction

### Implementation Details
1. Transaction Preparation:
   ```typescript
   const transaction = {
       from: senderAddress,
       to: recipientAddress,
       value: amountInWei.toHexString(),
       nonce: currentNonce.toHexString(),
       gasPrice: gasPrice,
       gasLimit: '0x5208',
       chainId: network.chainId
   };
   ```

2. Transaction Signing:
   ```typescript
   const signedTx = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
   ```

3. Transaction Sending:
   ```typescript
   const txHash = await rpcCall('eth_sendRawTransaction', [signedTx]);
   ```

### Successful Results
- All 10 test transfers completed successfully
- Each transaction received a valid transaction hash
- Nonce management working correctly (incrementing for each transaction)
- Gas price and limits accepted by the network

### Best Practices
1. Always use hex strings for numeric values
2. Include all required transaction fields
3. Sign transactions before sending
4. Handle nonce increment for multiple transactions
5. Use standard gas limit (21000) for simple transfers
6. Maintain proper error handling and logging
